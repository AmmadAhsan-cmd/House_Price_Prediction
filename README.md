# House_Price_Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning models based on a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. Through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation, we tested different models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The Random Forest model showed the best performance with the lowest RMSE and highest RÂ² value. This project demonstrates practical applications of data science techniques and machine learning algorithms in real estate price prediction.
